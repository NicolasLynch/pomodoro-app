> The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks of 5 minutes. Each interval is known as a "pomodoro". After three pomodoros are done, take the fourth pomodoro and then take a long break (traditionally 15 minutes). Once the long rest is over, repeat the cycle.
